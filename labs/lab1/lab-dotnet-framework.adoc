= Lab 1 - From Zero to Pushing Your .NET Framework First Application

== Target

. If you haven't already, download the latest release of the Cloud Foundry CLI from https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases for your operating system and install it.

. Set the API target for the CLI: (set appropriate end point for your environment)
+
----
$ cf api https://api.sys.gn01.pcf.dcsg.com --skip-ssl-validation
----

. Login to Pivotal Cloud Foundry:
+
----
$ cf login
----
+
Follow the prompts

== Clone the Sample Project

. Clone the .NET Framework _PCF DotNet Environment Viewer_ application
----
$ cd $BOOTCAMP_HOME/..
$ git clone https://github.com/mid-atlantic-pa/pcf-dotnet-environment-viewer.git
----

== Build the Sample Project

. Open the visual studio solution at $BOOTCAMP_HOME/../pcf-dotnet-environment-viewer/ViewEnvironment.sln
. Choose Build -> Build Solution

== Push It!

. Change to the _pcf-dotnet-environment-viewer_ sample application directory:
+
----
$ cd $BOOTCAMP_HOME/../pcf-dotnet-environment-viewer/ViewEnvironment
----

. Push the application!
+
----
$ cf push
----
+
You should see output similar to the following listing. Take a look at the listing callouts for a play-by-play of what's happening:

<1> The CLI is using a manifest to provide necessary configuration details such as application name, memory to be allocated, and path to the application artifact.
Take a look at `manifest.yml` to see how.
<2> All HTTP/HTTPS requests to applications will flow through Cloud Foundry's front-end router called http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/router.html[(Go)Router].
Here the CLI is creating a route with random word tokens inserted (again, see `manifest.yml` for a hint!) to prevent route collisions across the default `pcf.dcsg.com` domain.
<3> The CLI finally uploads the application bits to Pivotal Cloudfoundry. Notice that it's uploading _75 files_! This is because Cloud Foundry actually explodes a ZIP artifact before uploading it for caching purposes.
<4> Now we begin the staging process. The https://github.com/cloudfoundry/hwc-buildpack[HWC Buildpack] is responsible for assembling the runtime components necessary to run the application.
<5> The complete package of your application and all of its necessary runtime components is called a _droplet_.
Here the droplet is being uploaded to Pivotal Cloudfoundry's internal blobstore so that it can be easily copied to one or more _http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/execution-agent.html[Droplet Execution Agents (DEA's)]_ for execution.
<6> Finally the CLI reports the current status of your application's health.
====

. Visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was generated by the CLI:

== Interact with App from CF CLI

. Get information about the currently deployed application using CLI apps command:
+
----
$ cf apps
----
+
Note the application name for next steps

. Get information about running instances, memory, CPU, and other statistics using CLI instances command
+
----
$ cf app <<app_name>>
----

. Stop the deployed application using the CLI
+
----
$ cf stop <<app_name>>
----

. Delete the deployed application using the CLI
+
----
$ cf delete <<app_name>>
----
